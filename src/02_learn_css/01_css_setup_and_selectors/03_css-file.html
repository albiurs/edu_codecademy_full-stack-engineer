<!--Linking the CSS File-->

<!--Perfect! We successfully separated structure (HTML) from styling (CSS), but the web page still looks bland. Why?-->

<!--When HTML and CSS code are in separate files, the files must be linked. Otherwise, the HTML file won’t be able to locate the CSS code, and the styling will not be applied.-->

<!--You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:-->

<!--href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.-->
<!--type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.-->
<!--rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.-->

<!--When linking an HTML file and a CSS file together, the <link> element will look like the following:-->

<!--<link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">-->

<!--Note that in the example above the path to the stylesheet is a URL:-->

<!--https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css-->

<!--Specifying the path to the stylesheet using a URL is one way of linking a stylesheet.-->

<!--If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a relative path instead of a URL, like so:-->

<!--<link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">-->

<!--Using a relative path is very common way of linking a stylesheet.-->

<h2 class="destination">2. Beijing, China</h2>
<div class="description">A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

<h2 class="destination">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
<div class="description">The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.
