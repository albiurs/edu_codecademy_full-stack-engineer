<!--&lt;!&ndash;Audio and Attributes&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;Now that we learned about text-based content, let us dig into <audio>! Surely everyone needs
<audio>—how else would you listen to your Korean hip hop?&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;The <audio> element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like <video>, <audio> uses src to
link the audio source.&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<audio>-->
<!--    <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">-->
<!--</audio>-->

<!--In this example, we created an <audio> element. Then we created a <source> element to encapsulate our audio link.
In this case, iAmAnAudioFile.mp3 is our audio file. Then we specified the type by using type and named what kind of
audio it is. Although not always necessary, it’s recommended that we state the type of audio as it helps the browser
identify it more easily and determine if that type of audio file is supported by the browser.-->

<!--We linked our audio file into the browser but now we need to give it controls. This is where attributes come in.
Attributes provide additional information about an element.-->

<!--Attributes allow us to do many different things to our audio file. There are many attributes for <audio> but today
we’re going to be focusing on controls and src.-->

<!--    controls: automatically displays the audio controls into the browser such as play and mute.-->

<!--    src: specifies the URL of the audio file.-->

<!--As you might have noticed, we already used the src attribute. Most attributes go in the opening tag of <audio>.
For example, here’s how we could add both autoplay functionality and audio controls:-->

<!--<audio autoplay controls>-->

            <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
            <p>
                Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk times.

            <p>A study was conducted on dogs being away from their owners for varying hours and the studies show that dogs who were away from their owners the longest showed the greatest amount of affection!
