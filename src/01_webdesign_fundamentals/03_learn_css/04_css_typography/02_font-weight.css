/*Font Weight*/

/*You’ve probably noticed bold text in websites you use, especially in news or text-heavy sites. It’s common to bold important headings or keywords. In CSS, we can style bold text with the font-weight property.*/

/*If we want to bold text in a web page, we can set the font-weight to bold.*/

p {
    font-weight: bold;
}

/*If we want to ensure that text is not bold, we can set the font-weight to normal.*/

p {
    font-weight: normal;
}

/*By default, the font-weight of most text elements is set to normal. Some elements, like headers, have built-in bold styling. A good approach is to check to see if the text element has any default styling, and use the font-weight property accordingly.*/

/*The font-weight property can also be assigned a number value to style text on a numeric scale ranging from 100 to 900. Valid values are multiples of 100 within this range such as 200 or 500.*/

/*400 is the default font-weight of most text.*/
/*700 signifies a bold font-weight.*/
/*300 signifies a light font-weight.*/

/*Let’s take a look at an example of how numeric fonts are used.*/

header {
    font-weight: 800;
}

footer {
    font-weight: 200;
}

/*Here, the header would appear as a deep bold, while the footer would appear rather light.*/

/*It’s important to note that not all fonts can be assigned a numeric font-weight. You can look up the font you are using to see which font-weight values are available.*/
