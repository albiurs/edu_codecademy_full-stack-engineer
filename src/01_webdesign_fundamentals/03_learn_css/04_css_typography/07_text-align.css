/*Text Alignment*/

/*No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser.*/

/*To move, or align, text, we can use the text-align property.*/

h1 {
    text-align: right;
}

/*The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:*/

/*    left - aligns text to the left hand side of the browser.*/
/*    center - centers text.*/
/*    right - aligns text to the right hand side of the browser.*/

/*Later in the course, you’ll learn exactly how the browser positions HTML elements by default, which will help you
understand how the browser “aligns” text, since “align” is a relative term. For now, it’s enough to know that text can
be moved to the left, center, or right side of the web page.*/
