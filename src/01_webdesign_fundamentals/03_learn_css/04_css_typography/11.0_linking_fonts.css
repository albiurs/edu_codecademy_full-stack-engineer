/*Linking Fonts I*/

/*With the Number of fonts available with modern typography, it is unrealistic to expect users to have all fonts
installed on their computers. New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to
these fonts as non-user fonts.*/

/*Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available for free use. Google Fonts gives us a
way to retrieve the link for a single font, multiple fonts, or multiple fonts with the font-weight and font-style
properties.*/

/*We’ll show you where to add this link in the next exercise.*/

/*https://fonts.google.com/*/



/*Linking Fonts II*/

/*When we have the link to the font and the styles of our choice, we can add the font to the <head> section of the HTML document, using the <link> tag and the href property.*/

/*Let’s take a look at a few examples:*/

/*1. A single linked font, using Open Sans as an example:*/

/*<head>*/
/* <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet">*/
/*</head>*/

/*2. Multiple linked fonts, using the Open Sans and Playfair Display fonts as an example:*/

/*<head>*/
/* <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&family=Playfair+Display" rel="stylesheet">*/
/*</head>*/

/*3. Multiple linked fonts, along with weights and styles. Here Open Sans has font weights of 400, 700, and 700i, while Playfair Display has font weights of 400, 700, and 900i:*/

/*<head>*/
/* <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,700&family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,900" rel="stylesheet">*/
/*</head>*/

/*Once a font is linked, we can create CSS selectors to target elements, just as we do with other fonts.*/
