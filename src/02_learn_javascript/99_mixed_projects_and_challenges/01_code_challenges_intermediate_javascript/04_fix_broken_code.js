// We wrote a function, smallestPowerOfTwo(), which takes in an array.
//
// Within our function, we create a new array results. We loop through the argument array and push in the smallest
// power of two which is greater than the current element.
//
// Itâ€™s not doing what we want. Can you fix our code, please?
